These files are meant to be sample files to help you build your own
forum as fast as possible.

Normally, you would put the English.properties (French.properties is
not needed for this sample) together with forumsample.properties.

Then, forumsample.css and forumsample.html would go into the /sample
directory of your web server (so that http://mydomain/sample/forumsample.html
points to forumsample.html).

See the readme.html file for more details.
